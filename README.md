# Sales Prediction

Sales Prediction involves forecasting the quantity of products customers will purchase, considering factors such as price, sales and such. The dataset has 12 features and 8523 rows. 

## Overview 

With the target of predicting item outlet sales, this becomes a regression problem. The dataset underwent exploratory data analysis, visualizations and preprocessing. Two models were used, namely Linear Regression Model and Random Forest Regressor. The models were compared using its Correlation Coefficient (R2) and its root mean squared error (RMSE).

## Recommended Model: Random Forest Regressor Model

Using the two aforementioned metrics, the Random Forest Regressor Model is suggested due to its better R2 scores and lower RMSE scores.
